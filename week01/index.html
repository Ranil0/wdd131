            <p>My name is Ranilo, and I am from Cebu, Philippines. I am presently residing in Baku, Azerbaijan
                as I join my wife here who works at school as a teacher. I love photography as my one of my hobbies aside 
                from learning new interesting stuff, like coding. I really enjoy travelling with my families when all of us are present.</p>

            <p>The Philippines, officially the Republic of the Philippines, is an archipelagic country 
			   in Southeast Asia. In the western Pacific Ocean, it consists of 7,641 islands, with a total 
			   area of 300,000 square kilometers, which are broadly categorized in three main geographical divisions
			   from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The Philippines is bounded by the South China Sea to the
			   west, the Philippine Sea to the east, and the Celebes Sea to the south. It shares maritime borders with Taiwan
			   to the north, Japan to the northeast, Palau to the east and southeast, Indonesia to the south, Malaysia to the southwest,
			   Vietnam to the west, and China to the northwest. It is the world's twelfth-most-populous country, with diverse ethnicities
			   and cultures. Manila is the country's capital, and its most populated city is Quezon City. Both are within Metro Manila.
